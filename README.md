# genki-3001

Interim testnet. 

genki-3000 died to a [state machine bug](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3003). 
Long live genki-3001!

The network will do a quick start, and everyone can join in later by creating a validator
on the running the chain. There is NO disadvantage if you join later, so please only register
for genesis if you intend to be present! Otherwise, you will make life hard for everyone.

## Getting started

Download the final genesis file from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/certusone/genki-3001/master/genesis-final.json` and store it as `$HOME/.gaiad/config/genesis.json`

Add the following seed nodes `148228bd2d2e155e9edb339a7d664ea1242e6177@seed01.genki.certus.one:26656,89d30fa17d219ace5e57fac71ae64aeca860caea@seed02.genki.certus.one:26656`
